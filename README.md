**Summary:**
In the Smartphone Market Analysis project, I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of smartphone sales data to uncover valuable insights into market trends, brand performance, and customer preferences. 

**What I Did:**
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** I started by loading the dataset and performed necessary data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and renaming columns for clarity.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Through a series of SQL queries, I delved into the dataset to extract meaningful insights. I analyzed sales trends, identified top-selling brands, examined price distributions, and explored customer preferences based on memory and storage configurations.

3. **Advanced Analytics:** I conducted more advanced analytics by calculating average ratings for each brand, categorizing brands based on their average ratings, and segmenting mobile phones by price ranges within each brand.

4. **Insights and Findings:** Through my analysis, I uncovered several key findings:
   - Top-selling brands by revenue were identified, providing insights into market dominance.
   - Customer preferences for memory and storage configurations varied across brands, influencing product popularity.
   - Seasonal sales trends revealed fluctuations in demand throughout the year, guiding strategic planning.
   - Market share analysis highlighted the competitive landscape, with certain brands commanding a larger share.
   - Price-performance ratio analysis shed light on the value proposition offered by different brands.
   - Feature popularity analysis identified the most sought-after memory and storage configurations among consumers.

**Power BI Visualization:**
To enhance my analysis and provide stakeholders with interactive visualizations, I utilized Power BI to create dynamic dashboards. These visualizations included bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, allowing users to explore the data visually and gain deeper insights into smartphone sales trends and brand performance.
